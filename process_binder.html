  <h2>Process Binder #1</h2>
  <h4>Jan 29, 2019</h4>
  <p>
    From working on my project last semester and over winter break
    I have completed the hardest part of my project.
    The part being the coding of the keyboard.
    It is able to play one octave from C to B with sharps and flats.
    It is also able to switch between octaves on the keyboard both
    going up and down the piano. I also finished my PCB board to make
    the wiring flatter than the prototype wiring. I received the PCBs
    during the first week of school and soldered the parts onto the board.
  </p>
  <h4>Jan 30, 2019</h4>
  <p>
    I continued to work on my website today and
    refactored the way that it looks
  </p>
  <h4>Feb 4, 2019</h4>
  <p>
    Today I tried to make the code that is on the Arduino
    more easily readable by someone who may not have a coding background.
  </p>
  <h4>Feb 6, 2019</h4>
  <p>
    Today I worked more on my website and the information that it holds on it.
  </p>
  <h4>Feb 11, 2019</h4>
  <p>
    I worked on my 3D printed case to have it ready to print on Wednesday
  </p>
  <h4>Feb 14, 2019</h4>
  <p>
    I have started printing some of the case parts.
    The part that I printed today was the top case where
    I am putting the knobs so I created a 3D printed top
    to put the knobs into and screw holes for the screws
    to go through to keep the top case and the bottom of
    the case together. After I printed the top I found that
    the knobs fit fine in the holes for them, but the screws
    do not fit in the holes that I need for them and that I
    forgot to create holes for the octave keys.
  </p>
  <h2>Process Binder #2</h2>
  <h4>Feb 18, 2019</h4>
  <p>
    I have changed my website around so that the
    equalizer bars are centered and not covered by text
  </p>
  <h4>Feb 20, 2019</h4>
  <p>
    I have decided that I want to move my process binder
    to the website at some point when I figure out how to
    make different pages on the website
  </p>
  <h4>Feb 24, 2019</h4>
  <p>
    I have decided in the sort of direction
    I would like to go in for my website. I would
    like to have different pages on the website and
    for there to be a drop down navigational menu
  </p>
  <h4>Feb 28, 2019</h4>
  <p>
    I have found the perfect example of the menu I
    want on codepen, now all I have to do is to
    refactor it so that I can get it to do what I want it to do.
  </p>
  <h4>Mar 5, 2019</h4>
  <p>
    Today I have printed a prototype part that I
    wanted for the top of the case. I think that it
    came out well and I need to redesign the bottom part of the case.
  </p>
  <h4>Mar 7, 2019</h4>
  <p>
    Today I have redesigned the bottom part of the
    case and now I just need to print the prototype

  <h4>Journal #1</h4>
  <p>
    The question that my partner had was:
What do I plan on doing for Artsfest as it relates to my project?
This is something that I have thought about but haven’t put such a high priority on it

They also had some input that I thought was useful which was:
Some kind of timeline for the rest of the semester (improvements, changes, additions)
Add more components if time provides

And they really wanted to push the fact that ArtsFest should have some sort of plan

When I asked them what they would want it to look like they said:
Want it to look slick/sleek
Make the top curved
</p>

  <h4>Creativity Challenge</h4>
  <p>
    I decided to use the Boredom creativity challenge by putting
    my phone in a different room while I work. It seems to have worked
    relatively well because I was unable to distract myself with social
    media and texting.
  </p>
  <h4>First Look Reflection</h4>
  <p>
    I think that my first look went pretty well.
    The only thing that I would have changed would
    have been the way that I presented my information on the slides.
  </p>
  <h4>Alumni Day in Class</h4>
  <p>
    Today I learned how best to make sure my work is done.
    Both my roommate and I are in the same working group so
    it is probably best for us to be accountability partners
    to make sure that we get our capstones done.

  <h4>March 11</h4>
<p>Today I started to work on getting all of my stuff from tumblr to my website’s process binder
</p>
<h4>March 13</h4>
<p>I continued to move more and more stuff over but I have not pushed any changes to the website
</p>
<h4>March 19</h4>
<p>I got most of the information over but still have not pushed changes
</p>
<h4>March 21</h4>
<p>I have edited the website to make it look nicer
</p>
<h4>March 25<h4>
<p>I have not been keeping up with my project because I have been working in other work but I have gotten some more things updated
</p>
<h4>March 27</h4>
<p>My computer did not want to turn on this morning so if my work is still in my computer without me pushing changes
</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h4>April 1</h4>
    <p>I still do not have my laptop back so I am doing the most I can with the
      project which includes figuring out the hardware to use such as bolts and nuts</p>
  <h4>April 4</h4>
    <p>I finally got my computer back and luckily they were able to backup my
      entire laptop so I got to keep all of the code I was working on for the website</p>
  <h4>April 8</h4>
    <p>Updated the process binder for April 1st and started to look at ideas
      for what to make the process binder caledar look like</p>
  <h4>April 10</h4>
    <p>Found out that the wire I was going to use for communication with the
    Arduino Pro Micro does not fit inside the case so I soldered together a
  smaller version of the cord. In hindsight if I knew this information I would have soldered the
male micro USB straight into the female USB B port</p>
